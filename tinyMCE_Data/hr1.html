<h3>The first Yummy Coffee to open in Canada was at the Metrotown Skytrain Station in Burnaby on April 1, 1988. This store was Yummy Coffee&rsquo;s first cafe to open outside of China, and since then Canadians have been embracing the Yummy Experience in 27 company-operated and licensed locations across Canada.</h3>
<h3>Our cafes are not the only place you can enjoy our great coffee. In fact, we have various channels within Canada like grocery, lodging and restaurants; we offer additional brands like Chinese Best Coffee and Tazo. Our future is bright with growth and continued recognition that Canada is a strong contributor to the global business.</h3>
